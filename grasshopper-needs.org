* What we need from grasshopper
** Some way to resolve UDP address
Basically just formats the UDP addr correctly.  See:
https://golang.org/src/net/udpsock.go?s=1193:1248#L38
Maybe we can use the native C stuff from: https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/417/notes/sockets/udp.html
** Some way to dial UDP
This could probably be encapsulated in file writing.  We could just
write to a file and have some other function (not in grasshopper)
query the server.  The go implementation has a lot of networking.  
** Write
Write to file. 
** Bit ops
Not required, but would be useful for time calculations
We could get around this if necessary, since it's just calculations
and selecting specific parts of arrays
